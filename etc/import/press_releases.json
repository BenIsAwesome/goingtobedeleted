In addition, Kony introduces several significant enhancements to its platform providing the most complete HTML5 support.<br /> \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt Kony, we believe the future includes native, mobile web, and HTML5 hybrid or \u2018mixed mode\u2019 applications,\u201dsaid Raj Koneru, CEO of Kony. \u201cUsing the KonyOne platform, developers are able to use a single code base to create optimized applications for any device, operating system or browser.

Further, KonyOne also supports the following key HTML5 updates:<br /> \u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>HTML5 Elements</strong>\u2013 including new form fields (i.e. numbers or date ranges), semantic elements, audio and video elements, data URLs for images and application caching \u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Touch Specific Features</strong>\u2013 with the ability to handle touch events and resolve them as a tap, double tap, long press or swipe. Kony One also brings gesture API support to any HTML5 deployment</li>\n<li><strong>CSS 3.0 Specifications</strong>\u2013 leveraging media queries to target CSS specific to device DPI, with CSS gradients, rounded corners and shadows along with 2D and 3D transitions</li>\n<li><strong>New JavaScript APIs</strong>\u2013 enabling features such as geolocation, hash change, local storage, Web SQL and native JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) parsing</li>\n<li><strong>Widget Enhancements</strong>\u2013 designed to improve the application user experience, new feature-rich widget enhancements include image-based 360 degree views, accordion views, scrollable Hbox or Vbox, dockable widgets like the App Menu or Header/Footer, as well as transitions between form and pop-up widgets</li>\n</ul><p> According to Gartner Research Director Michael J. King, \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see HTML5 browser and standard fragmentation even prior to the standard\u2019s ratification. The native device platforms are also beginning to differentiate themselves with all kinds of different physical and software form factors, and that rapid pace of innovation negates the ability for the standards body to provide standardized access to every feature. As such, it\u2019s important for companies not to think of HTML5 as an \u2018either/or\u2019, as it will be important to support both native and web-based deployment models.\u201d</p>\n<p> Kony also provides Single Page Application (SPA) support for a further enhanced user experience. Single Page Applications provide local rendering of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), by generating markup on the device, delivering consumers with a feature-rich experience with less latency. Kony\u2019s SPA is just one of many deployment models provided by KonyOne, with additional options including server URL based, wrapper with access to all native device features and a hybrid or \u201cmixed-mode\u201d application, along with native support.</p>\n<p> Koneru continued, \u201cKonyOne\u2019s state of the art architecture has a loose coupling of the layout, client side logic and server side capabilities.

Uniquely, the Kony Platform generates each client specific application, optimized for that channel and format whether that is a smartphone, mobile web browser, tablet, SMS, web gadget or kiosk, through its \u2018Write Once, Run Everywhere\u2019 single application definition rather than solely mobile web solutions or multiple code bases like other options on the market.</p>\n<p>Kony\u2019s solution also aptly addresses the issues raised by HTML5; one implementation of HTML5 doesn\u2019t ensure universal reach due to variants between browsers, carriers and continually evolving standards.

We\u2019ve developed Kony Healthcare and Life Sciences Solution Accelerators, along with our Platform, to be device and operating system agnostic, so these businesses are able to reach all their patients and members in the broadest sense regardless of the device or operating system.\u201d</p><p>Kony offers a true solution by enabling ubiquitous mobile deployments for companies seeking to engage with consumers and employees across all mobile channels, as well as more than 9,000 devices, 7 operating systems and 15 operating browsers without compromising native functionality. Uniquely, the Kony Platform generates each client specific application, optimized for that channel and format whether that is a smartphone, mobile web browser, tablet, SMS, web gadget or kiosk, through its \u2018Write Once, Run Everywhere\u2019 single application definition rather than solely mobile web solutions or multiple code bases like other options on the market.</p><p>Kony\u2019s solution also aptly addresses the issues raised by HTML5; one implementation of HTML5 doesn\u2019t ensure universal reach due to variants between browsers, carriers and continually evolving standards. The Kony Platform\u2019s \u2018Change Once, Change Everywhere\u2019 capability provides the healthcare and life sciences industries with future-proofed solutions, ensuring any change in message, flow, feature or design is simultaneously applied to the application across all extensible clients, achieving an effective, broad, and consistent mobile experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Kony </strong></p><p>Kony enables enterprises to offer consumers and employees feature-rich mobile applications in less time and at lower costs than any other solution. Leveraging a&nbsp;single application definition, applications are designed and developed just once, in a device-independent manner, and deployed across multiple channels, including native applications, HTML5 and device-optimized mobile web, SMS, web gadgets, kiosks, and tablets without compromises. Kony\u2019s unique platform is proven to future-proof a company\u2019s mobile investment by enabling applications to be changed once for all channels, ensuring faster adoption of new operating systems and standards as they are introduced, while eliminating maintenance, upgrade and future development costs.</p><p>In 2011 Kony was positioned as a \u201cVisionary\u201d in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Consumer Application Platforms (MCAP) report by William Clark, Michael J. King and Linda Dozier. Kony has been named a <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.gartner.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;blank\\&quot;\">Gartner</a> Cool Vendor, a <a href=\"\\&quot;http://kony.com/about-us/press-room\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;blank\\&quot;\">\u2018Most Innovative Company of the Year\u2019</a> by the American Business Awards and waschosen as one of <em><a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;blank\\&quot;\">Fast Company\u2019s</a> </em>100 innovative Apple-affiliated achievers.</p><p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/\\&quot;\">www.kony.com</a>.

Following another fiscal year of successfully selling the leading mobile application platform and assembling world-class sales, services and support organizations, the company is expanding marketing to propel the Kony \u201cEmpowering Everywhere\u201d brand to deliver the product and brand experiences customers demand worldwide. &nbsp;</p><p>Buscemi, a results-oriented senior marketing leader for nearly 30 years, has both classic and progressive sales and marketing experience with Fortune 1000 companies, including <a href=\"\\http://www.hp.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">HP</a>, <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.apple.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.oracle.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Oracle</a>, <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.sap.com/solutions/sapbusinessobjects/large/business-intelligence/index.epx\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Business Objects</a>, <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.Actuate.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Actuate</a>, early stage, turnarounds and late stage privately held companies, such as <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.Aperture.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Aperture</a>. Peter has an exceptional ability to build brands, align sales and marketing and enter and dominate industries by aggressively acquiring and retaining customers. In this function at Kony, Buscemi is responsible for the strategy and execution of initiatives that drive awareness and demand for the company\u2019s products and technology.</p><p>\u201cKony\u2019s offering is extremely unique in the mobile space. No other company has such a robust platform and vertical applications across the spectrum of industries for consumers and employees,\u201d said Peter Buscemi, vice president of marketing, Kony. \u201cPart of the challenge will be to educate the market as brands develop their mobile strategy. There is also the opportunity to connect with organizations that have embarked on a mobile initiative that has not yielded the desired results and has forced a restart.\u201d</p><p>2010 was a landmark year for Kony. In addition to growing revenue by 10x and becoming the mobile application platform vendor of choice for more than 45 Fortune 500 companies, the company received $19.1 million in Series A funding from <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.insightpartners.com/\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Insight Venture Partners</a>. The investment symbolized a vote of confidence in Kony\u2019s technology and founding principles and enabled further expansion into new markets.</p><p>In 2011 Kony has been named a <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.gartner.com\\&quot;\">Gartner</a> Cool Vendor, a <a href=\"\\&quot;http://kony.com/about-us/press-room\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">\u2018Most Innovative Company of the Year\u2019</a> by the American Business Awards and was chosen as one of <em><a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">Fast Company\u2019s</a> </em>100 innovative Apple-affiliated achievers.

This will allow us to manage the exponential growth in the market,\u201d explained Raj Koneru, Kony CEO. \u201cPeter has extensive marketing experience and an impressive track record of success.

The research, conducted by Vanson Bourne , revealed that 42 percent of retailers believe mobile commerce is already affecting shopping behaviour at physical retail locations, while a staggering 89 percent believe mobile will be as popular as ecommerce.

The consumers surveyed expressed a clear preference for mobile during the decision making process, with 60 percent claiming to use mobile internet to make decisions in a store or while shopping online. Similarly, 40 percent use mobile applications to make shopping decisions and 37 percent use a mixture of the two.

Retailers are limiting themselves by only serving customers in a few channels. If retailers don\u2019t serve their customers, they will go somewhere else. The data clearly shows some retailers are Brokerage significantly in this channel to win those customers. They will attract those customers. The only way to leapfrog the competition and ensure the success of any mobile strategy is to provide customers with a comprehensive offering with those must-have mobile features and functions.\u201d</p>\n<p> According to Mark Blowers, Practice Leader at Ovum, \u201cAs customer experience differentiation grows more important in the competitive retail environment, retailers should look at mobile, not only as a sales channel but also as a vital tool for customer interaction in a complete multichannel retail operation. When developing mobile application strategies, retailers must not think of mobile as a silo but from the outset, integrate the channel into the existing operation.\u201d</p>\n<p> Finally, the survey also explored the development of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, consumer attitudes towards mobile payments, and how retailers plan to implement the technology within their stores. 57 percent of retailers surveyed are considering the technology as part of their overall mobile strategy, citing competitive pressures and customer demand as key drivers for this decision. A quarter of consumers already want to use their mobiles to pay for items in-store as opposed to using cards or cash despite the low awareness of the technology among consumers. Consumers cite convenience (59 percent) as the reason for using mobile payments. Security concerns (39 percent) remain a key reason why consumers say they don\u2019t want to pay with mobile, suggesting a real opportunity for retailers to significantly increase interest in mobile payments by addressing these concerns and this lack of education since NFC provides significantly security advantages.</p>\n<p> Detailed results of the survey can be found at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"\\http://www.johnsonking.com/library/Full_Kony_Research_13_Apr_2011.pdf\\&quot;\">http://www.johnsonking.com/library/Full_Kony_Research_13_Apr_2011.pdf\u00a0</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>About Kony\u00a0</strong><br /> Kony and the Kony Platform\u2122 enable Fortune 500 companies to offer consumers and employees feature-rich mobile applications in less time and at lower costs than any other solution.

These companies have been in a frenzy to launch mobile offerings that capture the attention of consumers and keep them one step ahead of competitors. From identifying consumer\u2019s mobile needs to dealing with the onslaught of new mobile device introductions, CMOs and CIOs are pulled in too many directions and are often overwhelmed by the task of developing a successful mobile offering that reaches all consumers across all devices.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe additional revenue potential in mobile applications for consumer brands is astronomical. With the variety of devices, operating systems, features and capabilities that brands face today, it\u2019s near impossible for a company to parse out what\u2019s going to make them successful in the space and give them the greatest bang for their mobile dollar,\u201d said Raj Koneru, CEO of\u00a0<a href=\"\\http://www.kony.com/\\&quot;\">Kony, Inc.</a>, the mobile application platform provider with\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/platform/write-once-run-everywhere/\\&quot;\">Write Once, Run Everywhere</a>\u00a0technology, enabling applications to be designed and developed just once, in a device independent manner, and deployed across multiple channels, including on-device applications, mobile web, SMS, web gadgets, kiosks, and tablets.</p>\n<p> Koneru continued, \u201c2011 provides brands with an opportunity to slow down and really strategize about their mobile portfolio, make the right investments and find the right partner that will help them to protect their investment and see solid return. With so many new innovations hitting the mobile market every day, it\u2019s essential for companies to understand which new features and trends will be most important to leverage in the New Year.\u201c Drawing on extensive experience designing, developing, and maintaining mobile portfolios for Fortune 500 brands across a variety of industries and the entire breadth of mobile devices, operating systems and channels on the market today, Kony predicts the five key trends these companies need to leverage as part of their mobile offering in 2011.</p>\n<p> <strong>1. Augmented Reality Meets Shopping</strong>\u00a0<br /> To-date augmented reality applications have been focused on navigation programs, being used primarily to direct users to a location. In 2011, the mobile space will see more experimentation with augmented reality. Applications will begin to harness its power to engage consumers, offering incentivizing information on products in-store. Consumers will be able to hold their phone\u2019s camera up to a product and see discounts or coupons on the product layered over the real-life image.</p>\n<p> <strong>2. Voice Is Key In Security</strong><br /> A significant roadblock to consumer adoption of mobile wallet technologies has been consumers\u2019 concerns over the security of storing sensitive information on their mobile handsets. Developers have attempted to quiet these concerns by implementing protection features such as multi-factor authentication to their apps. In 2011, voice biometrics will emerge as the new standard for security.<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.zdnetasia.com/citibank-to-roll-out-voice-biometrics-62203743.htm\\&quot;\">According to Citibank Australia CEO Roy Gori</a>, using an individual\u2019s voiceprint for security purposes can be more accurate than any other means of identification, while also making obsolete the typical series of log-in passwords and questions for users resulting in increased ease-of-use and consequently, adoption.</p>\n<p> <strong>3. Fence In Your Customers</strong><br /> In the last year, many applications have leveraged location-based technologies to provide consumers with a more personalized experience. 2011 will take location-based applications to a new level with \u201cgeofencing,\u201d a feature which allows companies to set up geofences around designated areas. For example, a retailer could set up a geofence to enable them to provide opt-in users with personalized discounts and other incentives as soon as they enter the specified area.</p>\n<p> <strong>4. 2011: The Year Of The Tablet</strong><br /> Tablets burst onto the scene as somewhat of a novelty in 2010 with Apple\u2019s launch of the iPad. With consumer adoption of tablets expected to increase exponentially\u2014ABI research predicts the shipment of more than 11 million tablets in 2010\u2014this new medium will continue to grow in importance for companies for brand recognition and additional revenue opportunities, especially across the media industry.</p>\n<p> <strong>5. Keep Track Of Your Investment</strong><br /> This year the fast-paced evolution of the mobile industry has caused a frenzy among consumer-facing corporations, prompting them to launch their mobile offerings so as not to miss out on opportunities or beat out the competition. 2011 will provide these companies with an opportunity to step back and implement analytics capabilities, allowing companies an opportunity to understand consumer adoption and usage. As such, 2011 will see a rise in companies\u2019 use of vendors that offer a complete end-to-end solution, with cost-effective hosting and mobile platform support. Keeping these trends and innovations in mind while planning for 2011 will help companies to create successful, competitive mobile offerings that capture consumer interest and increase revenue potential.</p>\n<p> For more information on how to implement a long-term mobile strategy, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/resource-center/\\&quot;\">/resource-center/</a>.</p>\n<p> \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>About Kony</strong><br /> Kony enables Fortune 500 companies to offer consumers and employees feature-rich mobile applications in less time and at lower costs than any other solution available through the\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/platform/\\&quot;\">Kony platform\u2122</a>\u00a0.

From identifying consumer\u2019s mobile needs to dealing with the onslaught of new mobile device introductions, CMOs and CIOs are pulled in too many directions and are often overwhelmed by the task of developing a successful mobile offering that reaches all consumers across all devices.<br /> <br /> \u201cThe additional revenue potential in mobile applications for consumer brands is astronomical. With the variety of devices, operating systems, features and capabilities that brands face today, it\u2019s near impossible for a company to parse out what\u2019s going to make them successful in the space and give them the greatest bang for their mobile dollar,\u201d said Raj Koneru, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"\\http://www.kony.com/\\&quot;\">Kony, Inc.</a>, the mobile application platform provider with&nbsp;<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/platform/write-once-run-everywhere/\\&quot;\">Write Once, Run Everywhere</a>&nbsp;technology, enabling applications to be designed and developed just once, in a device independent manner, and deployed across multiple channels, including on-device applications, mobile web, SMS, web gadgets, kiosks, and tablets.<br /> <br /> Koneru continued, \u201c2011 provides brands with an opportunity to slow down and really strategize about their mobile portfolio, make the right investments and find the right partner that will help them to protect their investment and see solid return. With so many new innovations hitting the mobile market every day, it\u2019s essential for companies to understand which new features and trends will be most important to leverage in the New Year.\u201c Drawing on extensive experience designing, developing, and maintaining mobile portfolios for Fortune 500 brands across a variety of industries and the entire breadth of mobile devices, operating systems and channels on the market today, Kony predicts the five key trends these companies need to leverage as part of their mobile offering in 2011.<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Augmented Reality Meets Shopping</strong>&nbsp;<br /> To-date augmented reality applications have been focused on navigation programs, being used primarily to direct users to a location. In 2011, the mobile space will see more experimentation with augmented reality. Applications will begin to harness its power to engage consumers, offering incentivizing information on products in-store. Consumers will be able to hold their phone\u2019s camera up to a product and see discounts or coupons on the product layered over the real-life image.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Voice Is Key In Security</strong><br /> A significant roadblock to consumer adoption of mobile wallet technologies has been consumers\u2019 concerns over the security of storing sensitive information on their mobile handsets. Developers have attempted to quiet these concerns by implementing protection features such as multi-factor authentication to their apps. In 2011, voice biometrics will emerge as the new standard for security.<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.zdnetasia.com/citibank-to-roll-out-voice-biometrics-62203743.htm\\&quot;\">According to Citibank Australia CEO Roy Gori</a>, using an individual\u2019s voiceprint for security purposes can be more accurate than any other means of identification, while also making obsolete the typical series of log-in passwords and questions for users resulting in increased ease-of-use and consequently, adoption.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Fence In Your Customers</strong><br /> In the last year, many applications have leveraged location-based technologies to provide consumers with a more personalized experience. 2011 will take location-based applications to a new level with \u201cgeofencing,\u201d a feature which allows companies to set up geofences around designated areas. For example, a retailer could set up a geofence to enable them to provide opt-in users with personalized discounts and other incentives as soon as they enter the specified area.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. 2011: The Year Of The Tablet</strong><br /> Tablets burst onto the scene as somewhat of a novelty in 2010 with Apple\u2019s launch of the iPad. With consumer adoption of tablets expected to increase exponentially\u2014ABI research predicts the shipment of more than 11 million tablets in 2010\u2014this new medium will continue to grow in importance for companies for brand recognition and additional revenue opportunities, especially across the media industry.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Keep Track Of Your Investment</strong><br /> This year the fast-paced evolution of the mobile industry has caused a frenzy among consumer-facing corporations, prompting them to launch their mobile offerings so as not to miss out on opportunities or beat out the competition. 2011 will provide these companies with an opportunity to step back and implement analytics capabilities, allowing companies an opportunity to understand consumer adoption and usage. As such, 2011 will see a rise in companies\u2019 use of vendors that offer a complete end-to-end solution, with cost-effective hosting and mobile platform support. Keeping these trends and innovations in mind while planning for 2011 will help companies to create successful, competitive mobile offerings that capture consumer interest and increase revenue potential.<br /> <br /> For more information on how to implement a long-term mobile strategy, please visit&nbsp;<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/resource-center/\\&quot;\">/resource-center/</a>.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Kony</strong><br /> Kony enables Fortune 500 companies to offer consumers and employees feature-rich mobile applications in less time and at lower costs than any other solution available through the&nbsp;<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/platform/\\&quot;\">Kony platform\u2122</a>&nbsp;.

The good news is that companies don\u2019t have to plan their mobile offerings alone \u2013 an experienced mobile vendor can optimize their investment and ensure they\u2019re up-to-date on all the latest mobile advancements, without falling into any of the mobile \u2018don'ts.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p> With experience designing, executing and maintaining mobile offerings for Fortune 500 companies across several verticals, including the retail, travel, media and financial services verticals, Kony outlines the top five \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d to consider when developing your mobile strategy:</p>\n<p> <strong>1. Don\u2019t Put All of Your Eggs in the iPhone Basket</strong><br /> While the <a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.apple.com/iphone/\\&quot;\">iPhone</a>\u00a0continues to be a much buzzed about device,\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/9/comScore_Reports_July_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share\\&quot;\">comScore</a>\u00a0recently reported that\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.rim.com/\\&quot;\">RIM</a>actually continues to capture the most smartphone market share and the\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.android.com/\\&quot;\">Android</a>\u00a0has actually surpassed Apple\u2019s iPhone. Companies who focus all of their mobile efforts solely on the iPhone thus risk ignoring a large share of consumers. A smart, fully integrated mobile strategy will leverage technology such as a\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/platform/write-once-run-everywhere/\\&quot;\">single application definition</a>\u00a0to create a mobile offering that can be deployed across the breadth of mobile devices and operating systems.</p>\n<p> <strong>2. Don\u2019t Forget: All Phones Are Not Created Equal</strong><br /> In a competitive mobile device market, manufacturers have introduced several device-specific unique capabilities to consumers. These consumers have come to expect mobile applications to leverage these functionalities to improve the user experience, including augmented reality or multi-tasking. Unfortunately, many vendors use a \u201clowest common denominator\u201d approach to enable a mobile website or app to run on all devices. This practice can negatively affect consumer adoption rates. Instead, companies should work to enhance the functionality of each mobile operating system to deliver the highest levels of application performance and retain the powerful native capabilities of each device.</p>\n<p> <strong>3. Don\u2019t Think Short Term</strong><br /> While companies may be eager to launch a mobile offering immediately, it\u2019s also imperative to consider a mobile strategy from a long-term standpoint. What are the goals and objectives for the offering now, as well as in the future? Companies must consider how they can future-proof their investment against the continuous introduction of new devices and operating systems. To maximize a company\u2019s mobile budget, businesses should create a mobile roadmap, considering potential monetization opportunities from the get-go in order to build a sustainable mobile strategy.</p>\n<p> <strong>4. Don\u2019t Rely Solely on mobile web</strong><br /> Though it may be tempting to simply port a company\u2019s online website into a mobile website, the performance of this type of site just won\u2019t live up to consumer expectations. Smartphone users are increasingly savvy, and expect to be able to access company information on-the-go. Long download times via mobile web, as well as the need for constant online connectivity, can stunt adoption and consumer\u2019s access to a brand. A truly integrated mobile offering should give consumers the option to access mobile web, mobile, tablet and kiosks, and even SMS campaigns.</p>\n<p> <strong>5. Don\u2019t Underestimate the Mobile Headache</strong><br /> Many companies assume the work has been done once a mobile offering has been launched. However, in such a fragmented mobile landscape, new devices continue to be introduced to the market and companies must constantly refresh their mobile offerings in order to remain competitive across all devices. This kind of maintenance and upkeep, along with security, hosting, and reporting can be expensive and time consuming for a business. Be sure to work with a vendor that offers a complete end-to-end solution, with cost-effective hosting and mobile platform support.<br /> Keeping these \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d top of mind, companies can ensure that they are equipped to plan their mobile strategy for 2011 and to select a compatible mobile vendor.</p>\n<p> For more information on how to implement a long-term mobile strategy, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/resource-center/\\&quot;\">/resource-center/</a>.</p>\n<p> <strong>About Kony</strong><br /> Kony enables Fortune 500 companies to offer consumers and employees feature-rich mobile applications in less time and at lower costs than any other solution available through the\u00a0<a href=\"\\&quot;http://www.kony.com/platform/\\&quot;\">Kony platform\u2122\u00a0</a>.

In addition to sales and commerce functions, informational resources (75 percent) brand awareness (61 percent) and customer service and support (56 percent) were components of their mobile strategy.</p>\n<p> This comes on the heels of a recent Deloitte study that found 21 percent consumers have used a web-enabled mobile phone in the shopping process. Mobile commerce is a small but high-growth area in retail. According to ABI Research Inc., shoppers will order $2.2 billion of physical goods from websites via mobile devices this year, $1 billion more than last year and five times more than 2008.</p>\n<p> While retail companies clearly were the top respondents to indicate plans to offer mobile commerce capabilities (82 percent), travel and hospitality businesses came in second with 58 percent. A strategic direction toward mobile commerce offerings is also supported by a recent comScore study that ranked online retail among the fastest growing content categories accessed via mobile applications, indicating a 91 percent year-over-year increase. The fragmented mobile landscape is an issue for companies looking to offer mobile solutions to consumers. As expected, respondents indicated that they considered the iPhone to be their highest priority operating system to support. Blackberry and Android tied for second priority. Considering a 2010 Gartner report estimated the iPhone holds less than three percent of the mobile market share, a dichotomy exists between the pervasiveness of the mobile device and its perceived importance.</p>\n<p> Additionally, the survey found that companies consider offering a mobile website to be the highest priority (73 percent), while downloadable mobile applications were their second priority (66 percent) and the third most important was an SMS offering (55 percent). These findings indicate that companies are aware of the fragmented mobile landscape, but are not implementing comprehensive, multi-platform mobile marketing strategies.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the mobile landscape has created a unique, complicated and costly problem for consumer-centric organizations, however, it also offers lucrative opportunities,\u201d said Raj Koneru, founder and CEO of Kony. \u201cCompanies are unclear as to how best to balance the cost of developing and deploying mobile offerings across multiple devices with the need to reach the widest range of consumers. Consumer-facing businesses need to implement mobile solutions in the near term or risk disengagement. Additionally, the potential revenue stream and brand awareness from mobile offerings is too great to be ignored.\u201d</p>\n<p> In response to a question regarding the status of company\u2019s mobile offering, 30 percent of respondents indicated that some of their mobile solutions have launched with more to come in the future. Interestingly, 19 percent of companies had no plans to provide prospects and customers with mobile offerings, while 26 percent were still in the planning stages.</p>\n<p> Many companies expressed that they are insecure about their mobile offerings as compared to their competitors, with more than half indicating that they felt they were behind their competitors in terms of the mobile offerings. Notably, only 15 percent of companies consider themselves experts in developing mobile strategies and deploying mobile offerings. A quarter of respondents felt that they know very little about the development and deployment of mobile strategies, while 36 percent said they have a general understanding of what they want to offer and what it will take to get the job done.</p>\n<p> Koneru added, \u201cOrganizations need to educate themselves when it comes to mobile strategy development. Choosing the wrong partner, or trying to develop a solution in-house when it\u2019s not your expertise, is costly and can be a deadly mistake for the success of an application.
