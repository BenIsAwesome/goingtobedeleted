Of the British retailers surveyed, 84% agreed that making sure websites are optimized for mobile will be crucial for 2011. Despite these findings, many retailers have yet to take action. While the number of respondents who have used mobile rose slightly from M-Retailing\u2019s last survey, 35% have yet to leverage the channel in any form. In today\u2019s business landscape, it\u2019d be wrong to think that any company, especially retailers, can grow and be successful without a comprehensive mobile offering. Consumers are increasingly utilizing mobile when shopping \u2013 not just when they don\u2019t have the access to the brick-and-mortar stores, but even whilst they\u2019re physically shopping, for example to compare prices, read reviews, and even make purchases from their mobiles from a competing store if its offer is cheaper, whilst standing in the original shop the consumer is physically shopping in! However, retailers need to offer even more than just mobile web if they are to stay competitive. It is surprising that retailers are continuing to limit themselves by focusing on a single mobile channel - despite the widely reported fragmentation in the mobile market. While the survey\u2019s findings suggest that mobile internet is an absolute must-have, and first port of call for many retailers this year, it is important that this is just a company\u2019s first step, rather than its entire mobile strategy. In reality, the question of whether retailers choose to implement a mobile website or app is not as important as choosing to dedicate the necessary time and resources to developing a sound mobile strategy \u2013 and simply creating a mobile web wrapper is not enough! When it comes to mobile interaction, consumer preferences vary greatly in terms of the tools that they use \u2013 from the ever-growing field of location-based services to SMS to native mobile apps. Nowadays, there are so many options for consumers that if a retailer\u2019s mobile offering does not meet their expectations they can \u2013 and will \u2013 simply move on to a competitor that will. We\u2019ve have seen this happen, with the rate of conversion and return visits much higher when customers are given the option of native apps in addition to mobile web. The only way to ensure the success of any mobile strategy is to provide users with a comprehensive offering that allows them to perform several must-have mobile functions. What the survey doesn\u2019t address is new technologies, such as mobile payments, augmented reality and barcode scanning, which will all make for a better user experience and in turn help generate revenue. It\u2019s important that retailers, and any business for that matter, remember that constant innovation is critical as competition is fierce, and becoming stronger as companies get more experienced. Here at Kony, our cross-platform solutions allow retailers to cost effectively deploy an end-to-end mobile offering to any phone, tablet or browser from a single application definition, freeing them up to do what they do best - satisfy their customers.</p>\n",

With so many apps on the market, enterprises are finding it increasingly difficult to measure ROI when it comes to mobile apps, and the need to <a href=\"http://www.nma.co.uk/features/monetising-apps/3024235.article\" target=\"_blank\">monetize apps</a> is becoming ever more prevalent.\u00a0 There are two clear ways of doing this, firstly you can charge users to download and access specific content on your app (for instance, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/faq/ipad#faq4\" target=\"_blank\">Time magazine</a>), or secondly use advertising to fund your app (for instance, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/mar/29/ft-ipad-app\" target=\"_blank\">the FT</a>).\u00a0 The only other alternative is to provide free apps, seeing their value as driving sales leads and promoting the brand. The strategy that an organization chooses for its mobile app portfolio is driven mostly by what their competitors are doing.\u00a0 If a competitor has a cheaper or better quality app, they will likely win the customer over.\u00a0 This makes it is crucial to understand what\u2019s going on in the market place when devising an app strategy. In all cases the silver bullet of an app strategy is, as with most things, the simplest of solutions \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/top-25-android-apps-the-best-of-the-best/37363\" target=\"_blank\">quality</a>.\u00a0 If an app adds value to a customer they will use it.\u00a0 If the app doesn\u2019t add value and only costs the customer money or time in watching adverts, they will not use it.\u00a0 It\u2019s as simple as that. Make an app work for the customer and the monetary rewards will follow! To achieve this quality-driven app approach, a <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strategic end-to-end</a> view of mobile marketing is essential.\u00a0 A set procedure needs to be in place should a new device or new technology come on to the market to ensure the future is catered for.\u00a0 In addition to this, an app needs to cater to all customers and maximize the individual features on each and every device to ensure a consistently better app that is worth the cost incurred by monetizing.

With so many apps on the market, enterprises are finding it increasingly difficult to measure ROI when it comes to mobile apps, and the need to <a href=\"http://www.nma.co.uk/features/monetising-apps/3024235.article\" target=\"_blank\">monetize apps</a> is becoming ever more prevalent.&nbsp; There are two clear ways of doing this, firstly you can charge users to download and access specific content on your app (for instance, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/faq/ipad#faq4\" target=\"_blank\">Time magazine</a>), or secondly use advertising to fund your app (for instance, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/mar/29/ft-ipad-app\" target=\"_blank\">the FT</a>).&nbsp; The only other alternative is to provide free apps, seeing their value as driving sales leads and promoting the brand. The strategy that an organization chooses for its mobile app portfolio is driven mostly by what their competitors are doing.&nbsp; If a competitor has a cheaper or better quality app, they will likely win the customer over.&nbsp; This makes it is crucial to understand what\u2019s going on in the market place when devising an app strategy. In all cases the silver bullet of an app strategy is, as with most things, the simplest of solutions \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/top-25-android-apps-the-best-of-the-best/37363\" target=\"_blank\">quality</a>.&nbsp; If an app adds value to a customer they will use it.&nbsp; If the app doesn\u2019t add value and only costs the customer money or time in watching adverts, they will not use it.&nbsp; It\u2019s as simple as that. Make an app work for the customer and the monetary rewards will follow! To achieve this quality-driven app approach, a <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strategic end-to-end</a> view of mobile marketing is essential.&nbsp; A set procedure needs to be in place should a new device or new technology come on to the market to ensure the future is catered for.&nbsp; In addition to this, an app needs to cater to all customers and maximize the individual features on each and every device to ensure a consistently better app that is worth the cost incurred by monetizing. A best of breed app portfolio is the only way to draw in customers and make monetizing apps work.</p>"

Moreover continually, if it\u2019s not devices organizations are ignoring, its <a href=\"http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/opinion/columns/917.html\" target=\"_blank\">quality</a>.&nbsp; In a bid to have a presence, native features are ignored and the costs are prolific.&nbsp; Not only do customers suffer from a bad experience but an enterprises reputation amongst peers, investors and future customers will be damaged \u2013 often losing those crucially influential early adopters. The solution is simple: <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/platform/\" target=\"_blank\">technology</a>. The key is to go back to basics.&nbsp; Rather than continuing to adapt an existing insufficient mobile strategy, change it once and change it for the future.&nbsp; With the right technology a complete mobile offering can rely on a single adaptable code base that is designed to continually optimize each and every new device that comes on the market. \u201cThat sounds like a lot of work, every time a new device comes on the market,\u201d I hear you say.&nbsp; That is not the case though.&nbsp; Innovative technology makes <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/services/\" target=\"_blank\">this simple and takes away the mobile chaos</a>.&nbsp; The mantra of laying the right foundations before leaping into the unknown is true in many cases, particularly in the technology sector and especially in mobile.</p>"

The average number of apps you\u2019ll find on various operating systems is 48 on iPhones and 35 on Android phones, compared with 15 on the BlackBerry.

A journalist recently pointed out to me that the significantly higher rate of app downloads on iOS and Android systems did not mean that businesses are effectively connecting with their consumers on those platforms. Many of these apps, he said, are of such a low quality that they are merely downloaded never to be looked at again, and the number is only higher on iOS and Android because businesses are just throwing apps out into those markets without really thinking about their comprehensive mobile strategies.

This business mentality of only developing apps for one or two operating systems undoubtedly stems from the fact that traditionally, mobile application development on numerous mobile platforms and devices has proved to be an extremely difficult (and costly) technical challenge.

Organizations need a way to support this chaos, and also must remember that NFC is but one technology that will be in play. It's undeniably a good first step in the mobile payments space. Even though it will initially have limited reach, starting in a few cities and focusing on a few retailers, it will no doubt continue to grow at a breakneck pace.</p>"

Mobile marketing includes the use of mobile couponing through Short Message Service (SMS) for call-to-action and two-way chat functionality, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), mobile apps with push alerts and mobile web marketing. Aberdeen data shows that mobile messaging solutions in retail influence cross-channel customer engagement strategies through location-based customer messaging, couponing, and personalized marketing that ultimately improves conversion rates. Mobile retailing is also pervasive for consumers. According to Aberdeen's September 2010 Mobile Retail as a Reality, one of the top three most popular components of a mobile retail technology strategy is smart phone-platform specific mobile retail applications for iPhone, Android or Blackberry devices (37%). These applications provide consumers with unique brand experiences with graphic interface enhancements and touch-screen features to browse, compare, and order products. For instance, Pizza Hut launched its iPhone application in July 2009. This \"On-The-Go Ordering\" application has notched up over $1 million in sales (as reported by Mobile Marketer). In a recent conversation with Aberdeen, Pizza Hut CIO,Baron Concurs confirmed that Pizza Hut envisaged the mobile experience as an extension of the brand. At the upcoming Aberdeen retail summit, Baron Concors will share the strategy behind his company's award winning iPhone pizza ordering application, and the comprehensive integration strategy that has made it a success.

There is a quote in the article from <a href=\"http://www.screendigest.com/analysts/julien-theys/view.html\" target=\"_blank\">Julien Theys</a> \u2013 a Screen Digest analyst \u2013 that really resonated with me and truly reflects the value that Kony\u2019s solution gives to businesses.

A classic mistake is they say, \u2018Look, I just want an iPhone app\u2019.\u201d Theys also pointed out that all too often, businesses are developing apps as a way of \u2018box ticking\u2019 into the mobile arena without having to do any more, and should not approach mobile apps so \u2018half-heartedly\u2019. If you take a look at the statistics surrounding mobile apps, it\u2019s a massive surprise that organizations still believe that having an app on just one platform qualifies as a \u2018mobile strategy\u2019 \u2013 especially with the rate of mobile fragmentation continuing escalate to at breakneck speeds. Let\u2019s take the UK mobile market, for example. According to research by Screen Digest, in 2010 \u2013 which was only the second full year that mobile apps have been widely available \u2013 the UK mobile app market was worth \u00a395 million, equating to a total of 575 million downloads. The size of the market will more than triple by 2014, when it will be worth over \u00a3300 million \u2013 and downloads will hit 1.8 billion. Another set of interesting numbers showing how much apps are really worth is the amount of money Apple iAd (which makes ads available inside mobile apps) secured before it was even unveiled \u2013 a whopping $60 million, which is 50% of the total forecasted mobile ad spend in the US for second half of last year. This undoubtedly shows that businesses which don\u2019t take their mobile app strategies seriously will lose out on a massive chunk of potential revenue and be abandoned by their increasingly mobile-savvy customers. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/new-study-shows-retailers-are-unprepared-for-imminent-consumer-demand-for-mobile-commerce/\" target=\"_blank\">our own statistics</a> show that generally, retailers are still unprepared for increasing m-commerce demand \u2013 and this needs to change if they want to maintain a competitive edge. It is clear that when it comes to mobile apps, businesses certainly need to focus on content and producing a high-quality app. However, no matter how brilliant the app is, if it is only accessible on one platform, it will not reap the monetary rewards that mobile apps have the potential to bring in. Ultimately, the mobile app market is one of the fastest growing areas in the mobile arena, and businesses who aren\u2019t taking their app strategies by the horns will soon get left behind.</p>\n",

Undeniably, the issue of app monetization has long been a cause for concern within the mobile industry. However, these statistics clearly show that organizations are quickly running out of time to serve consumers the mobile apps that they demand, while still being able to profit from their mobile strategy \u2013 especially as many consumers shy away from paid-for apps and only take on free downloads. This report also coincides with the latest Google Android figures, as last week Android chief Andy Rubin also revealed that <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/mobile-devices/2011/06/29/google-claims-half-a-million-android-activations-daily-40093255/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 500,000 Android devices are activated each day worldwide</a>.

Apps catering to Apple devices tend to be more on the paid-for side, whilst Android\u2019s apps are generally renowned for being free. With this accelerating growth of Android device uptake, it seems clear that the future of apps is leaning towards the free download model.

The other crucial factor which will differentiate between organizations effectively utilizing mobile apps and those which don\u2019t truly understand how to monetize their mobile strategies is how they approach delivering their apps to all the devices their consumers are demanding \u2013 and all the future devices that will undoubtedly continue to be released at breakneck speeds.

Gotcha #4: <a href=\"http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/webjam.cfm?content=181792\" target=\"_blank\">BlackBerry is dead</a> Still commanding a large percentage of the market, BlackBerry represents how all platforms and operating systems \u2013 new or legacy \u2013 should be catered for.&nbsp; \u201cFuture proofed\u201d technology is essential to update automatically as soon as new software or devices become available. Gotcha #5: <a href=\"http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2092848/demand-grows-html5-developers\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile web</a> is enough It may be easy to implement and support a wide array of devices, but if it\u2019s not reliable, if it doesn\u2019t add value, if there\u2019re better alternatives \u2013 it won\u2019t be successful. Gotcha #6: Third party development costs are manageable and predictable Got your app, get a vendor to manage it?&nbsp; Perhaps not, with the amount of maintenance required and a volatile pricing structure, a third-party vendor often causes costs to extrapolate out of control. The answer is \u2013 build it once, build it all, build it right, and do it for the long haul.&nbsp; To read the full whitepaper click <a href=\"http://www.konysolutions.com/resources/white-papers\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. *PhoCusWright, Inc.

What is surprising is the lack of preparedness by businesses, particularly retailers, to truly capitalise on this lucrative opportunity.\u00a0 There is a huge <a href=\"http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/mobile-wireless/3273843/more-than-a-quarter-of-retailers-have-no-plans-for-mobile-commerce-survey-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">discrepancy between business strategies and consumer preferences</a> when it comes to mobile commerce, and as a result, new revenue streams are simply being ignored.\u00a0 With just 16 percent of retailers having a full mobile commerce strategy in place, the majority of retailers unfortunately need to rethink their strategies fast \u2013 and surveys such as this serve to increase the urgency. Unfortunately, this sudden realisation has lead to something of a mobile gold-rush, with many businesses clambering to claim a mobile presence as quickly as they can. With the sheer number of apps currently swelling the marketplace, and the ongoing platform battles further fragmenting the market, it is absolutely critical for businesses to differentiate themselves. The only way to do this is to develop a targeted, <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">multi-platform mobile strategy</a> that takes individual consumer preferences into account, whether that be native apps, mobile web, HTML5 or traditional SMS technology. With mobile becoming so integral to daily life, smartphone users take time and effort to choose their device.\u00a0 As such, any mobile offering should be developed with the same concern. A device-aware, future-proofed approach that takes advantage of the native features on any device will ensure that businesses consistently meet customer demand and stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n",

What is surprising is the lack of preparedness by businesses, particularly retailers, to truly capitalise on this lucrative opportunity.&nbsp; There is a huge <a href=\"http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/mobile-wireless/3273843/more-than-a-quarter-of-retailers-have-no-plans-for-mobile-commerce-survey-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">discrepancy between business strategies and consumer preferences</a> when it comes to mobile commerce, and as a result, new revenue streams are simply being ignored.&nbsp; With just 16 percent of retailers having a full mobile commerce strategy in place, the majority of retailers unfortunately need to rethink their strategies fast \u2013 and surveys such as this serve to increase the urgency. Unfortunately, this sudden realisation has lead to something of a mobile gold-rush, with many businesses clambering to claim a mobile presence as quickly as they can. With the sheer number of apps currently swelling the marketplace, and the ongoing platform battles further fragmenting the market, it is absolutely critical for businesses to differentiate themselves. The only way to do this is to develop a targeted, <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">multi-platform mobile strategy</a> that takes individual consumer preferences into account, whether that be native apps, mobile web, HTML5 or traditional SMS technology. With mobile becoming so integral to daily life, smartphone users take time and effort to choose their device.&nbsp; As such, any mobile offering should be developed with the same concern. A device-aware, future-proofed approach that takes advantage of the native features on any device will ensure that businesses consistently meet customer demand and stay ahead of the curve.</p>"

These influential changes in the mobile market simply go to prove that companies, no matter how much they try, can\u2019t predict the future.&nbsp; Organizations need to deliver what\u2019s needed now and they need to be ready for what\u2019s demanded in the future.&nbsp; Putting all of a company\u2019s eggs in to one basket, for example by only developing apps for the iPhone or not having a HTML5 offering for the latest smartphones, is a risky business.&nbsp; Rather than looking at the multiple apps and devices and hastily scraping together a sub-standard mobile offering, enterprises need to step back and look for a technology that can control the mobile chaos.&nbsp; A specifically designed <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/kony-platform\">code base</a> that can make an app available on a new device as soon as it comes onto the market, taking advantage of the native features on the device, means that a company\u2019s mobile strategy is future-proofed and of great quality \u2013 this is the only way to truly overcome the mobile chaos.</p>"

Back then, having NFC become a staple feature in mobile devices seemed like a distant possibility. Ever since, NFC seems to have come a long way from being the subject of mere speculation, to news stories about live deployments. Of course, it all starts with the device.

Google were also at the forefront of promoting NFC in mobile payments, with the <a href=\"../?p=501\">publishing of its \u2018Google Wallet\u2019 plans</a>, and no doubt its recent purchase of Motorola Mobility is a sure-fire sign of investment in Google Wallet.

NFC\u2019s uses are not limited to mobile payments, but for many, the terms \u2018NFC technology\u2019 and \u2018mobile payments\u2019 technology are synonymous. This looks set to set to change though, with developers increasingly looking to use NFC for <a href=\"http://www.smartgorillas.com/?p=5599\">augmented reality and location-based services</a>. Businesses will also be able to take advantage of NFC\u2019s benefits in the mobile marketing arena, and just last week, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/three-leading-nfc-mobile-marketing-firms-form-global-alliance/2011/09/08/gIQAuVCYCK_story.html\">three firms spanning the globe formed the \u201cNFC World Alliance\u201d</a> \u2013 an organization dedicated to NFC\u2019s development as a mainstream mobile marketing tool. The market growth of NFC is certainly gaining momentum. However, if there\u2019s no consumer buy-in to the technology, then this investment may all be wasted. The good news is that <a href=\"http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/consumersmobilespendup43point3percent060911.mxs\">recent research conducted by the UK\u2019s Internet Advertising Bureau</a> clearly shows that consumers are quickly embracing NFC as an addition to phones, with 74% of consumers stating they felt like NFC is a good idea. It seems clear that all the factors \u2013 from the availability of devices to consumer demand \u2013 are pointing towards an inflection point in the adoption of NFC technology. However, with numerous players in the market all vying for supremacy, this will only add to the chaos in the already fragmented mobile market. It is therefore crucial that businesses are able to support whichever devices their customers have \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/platform/write-once-run-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\">no matter what platform</a> that might be, whether iPhone, Android, Windows, Symbian and so on \u2013 if they are to support the different NFC systems that are inevitably going to start cropping up. The <a href=\"../?p=601\">breakneck speed at which the mobile industry has grown</a> should be an indicator of the rate at which new technologies like NFC will penetrate the market.

This looks set to set to change though, with developers increasingly looking to use NFC for <a href=\"http://www.smartgorillas.com/?p=5599\">augmented reality and location-based services</a>. Businesses will also be able to take advantage of NFC\u2019s benefits in the mobile marketing arena, and just last week, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/three-leading-nfc-mobile-marketing-firms-form-global-alliance/2011/09/08/gIQAuVCYCK_story.html\">three firms spanning the globe formed the \u201cNFC World Alliance\u201d</a> \u2013 an organization dedicated to NFC\u2019s development as a mainstream mobile marketing tool. The market growth of NFC is certainly gaining momentum. However, if there\u2019s no consumer buy-in to the technology, then this investment may all be wasted. The good news is that <a href=\"http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/consumersmobilespendup43point3percent060911.mxs\">recent research conducted by the UK\u2019s Internet Advertising Bureau</a> clearly shows that consumers are quickly embracing NFC as an addition to phones, with 74% of consumers stating they felt like NFC is a good idea. It seems clear that all the factors \u2013 from the availability of devices to consumer demand \u2013 are pointing towards an inflection point in the adoption of NFC technology. However, with numerous players in the market all vying for supremacy, this will only add to the chaos in the already fragmented mobile market. It is therefore crucial that businesses are able to support whichever devices their customers have \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/platform/write-once-run-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\">no matter what platform</a> that might be, whether iPhone, Android, Windows, Symbian and so on \u2013 if they are to support the different NFC systems that are inevitably going to start cropping up. The <a href=\"../?p=601\">breakneck speed at which the mobile industry has grown</a> should be an indicator of the rate at which new technologies like NFC will penetrate the market. Any business who\u2019s mobile strategy isn\u2019t future (and platform) proofed will quickly fall behind. &nbsp;</p>"

Consumers will no doubt continue to embrace any technology that truly adds value to their existing activities \u2013 be it social, news, shopping or dining \u2013 and there is no doubt that NFC delivers this. As a result, the technology is a game-changer for businesses across all industries. With this in mind, businesses need to have a complete mobile strategy in place that can incorporate diverse technologies, across <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">any mobile device</a>that consumers use, if they are to create truly lucrative opportunities from mobile. The best mobile experiences take advantage of the native features and technologies that a physical device has, one being NFC. The speed with which the mobile industry has grown is an indicator of the rate at which new technologies such as NFC will penetrate the market. Any business whose mobile strategy isn\u2019t future (and platform) proofed will quickly fall behind.</p>"

                    "safe_value": "<p>As tech gurus around the world pay their respects to Steve Jobs following his unfortunate death last week, the mobile industry is left wondering about the future.\u00a0 Without a doubt, as one of <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/10/05/president-obama-steve-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\">the world\u2019s most amazing innovators</a>, there are not only questions about what route Apple will take next, but also what steps will follow in the mobile industry. Having revolutionized the smartphone market with the iPhone, Apple set the pace, and other mobile providers were left catching up.\u00a0 Since then, the market has changed quite considerably, and with <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2011/09/27/android-tops-apple-iphone-in-market.html\">Android gaining an impressive lead</a> in the mobile space, the top spot for mobile hasn\u2019t been a sure thing for a while.\u00a0 That being said, everyone will always remember the first. Led by Jobs, Apple continued to keep the industry guessing with its introduction of the iPhone 4, and this week the iPhone 5 was widely anticipated \u2013 until it didn\u2019t arrive.\u00a0 Yet again, Apple has shown that the hype around its products can influence the market.\u00a0 There have been many <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/04/technology/apple_iphone_5/index.htm?section=money_topstories&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fmoney_topstories+%28Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+UK\">comments of disappointment</a> following the absent iPhone 5 announcement, but this only serves to fuel even more rumors of the <a href=\"http://www.webpronews.com/iphone-5-rumors-still-alive-and-well-despite-iphone-4s-2011-10\">follow up to the iPhone 4S</a>.

Having revolutionized the smartphone market with the iPhone, Apple set the pace, and other mobile providers were left catching up.&nbsp; Since then, the market has changed quite considerably, and with <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2011/09/27/android-tops-apple-iphone-in-market.html\">Android gaining an impressive lead</a> in the mobile space, the top spot for mobile hasn\u2019t been a sure thing for a while.&nbsp; That being said, everyone will always remember the first. Led by Jobs, Apple continued to keep the industry guessing with its introduction of the iPhone 4, and this week the iPhone 5 was widely anticipated \u2013 until it didn\u2019t arrive.&nbsp; Yet again, Apple has shown that the hype around its products can influence the market.&nbsp; There have been many <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/04/technology/apple_iphone_5/index.htm?section=money_topstories&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fmoney_topstories+%28Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+UK\">comments of disappointment</a> following the absent iPhone 5 announcement, but this only serves to fuel even more rumors of the <a href=\"http://www.webpronews.com/iphone-5-rumors-still-alive-and-well-despite-iphone-4s-2011-10\">follow up to the iPhone 4S</a>. The question is \u2013 who will be the next visionary, what will be the next innovation to transform the mobile world? &nbsp;Will it be a new device, a charismatic figure, perhaps a completely new mobile technology \u2013 or even an innovative new <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/\">mobile app platform</a>?

A few key pieces of research released recently have clearly revealed that the mobile industry is showing no signs of slowing down. Firstly, it\u2019s been reported that <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/12/02/smartphone-apps-set-to-surpass-the-1-million-mark-next-week/\">smartphone apps are set to pass the one million mark within the coming days</a>. With the extent at which the popularity of apps have boomed, it\u2019s hard to believe that the mobile app market is just three and a half years old \u2013 we\u2019re currently seeing a whopping average of 2,000 applications enter the mobile marketplace each day. This figure will no doubt only continue to increase, and organizations that don\u2019t have mobile apps as part of their business strategies are missing out on huge revenue opportunities. Gartner has also recently released its \u201c<a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1857814\">Gartner Predicts 2012</a>\u201d report, which provides a variety of insightful outlooks for the year to come in the portable devices market. \u00a0The report states that \u201cthe pace of change [in the mobile and tablet space] over the next four years will be breathtaking\u201d, and Gartner believes that smartphones and tablets will represent more than 90% of new net growth in device adoption in the coming four years, and this will then result in most client-side applications being made mobile only or mobile first. Furthermore, according to Gartner, the number of mobile and tablet app development projects will outnumber the number of native PC projects by 4:1 in 2015. The report also states that at least 50% of enterprise email users will rely on a browser, tablet or mobile client, instead of a desktop, by 2016. To me, these statistics don\u2019t just represent a huge growth in volume of the mobile market. Much more important than the large figures is that these developments as a whole signify a huge change in the world\u2019s perception of mobile. These reports have shown that no longer are mobiles and tablets considered luxury products, and no longer are mobile services viewed as add-ons to the consumer or enterprise experience. While consumer mobile apps are already considered a staple part of business to consumer relationships, Gartner\u2019s report shows that businesses are also increasingly comfortable with incorporating portable devices such as smartphones and tablets for enterprise operations. Clearly, mobile apps will only continue to infiltrate every part of our lives, and all organizations need to ensure that mobile strategies are incorporated into their business plans as a whole \u2013 otherwise, they will quickly fall behind the competition.</p>\n",

To briefly summarize Kony\u2019s point of view on the subject, we certainly believe that HTML5 will continue to be a significant factor the mobile space \u2013 so much so that our recently launched KonyOne 4.0 platform offers the most complete HTML5 support available on the market. HTML5 will be a key force behind powering single page apps and offering a snappier mobile web experience, which will help fuel an explosive growth of web apps that ultimately deliver an overall better user experience. However, we expect an even bigger interest in hybrid apps - native apps that include HTML5 alongside native elements \u2013 as there are certainly benefits to both. According to Michael, \u201cit\u2019s important for companies not to think of HTML5 as an \u2018either/or\u2019, as it will be important to support both native and web-based deployment models\u201d. We were also very interested in hearing what you all have to say about the topic, so we conducted a survey of the webinar attendees, which consisted of more than 130 technology executives and mobile developers from global businesses. The responses were telling \u2013 when asked whether they are considering launching an HTML5 site for their company, a whopping 74 percent of respondents said yes. Clearly, HTML5 is already on the business agenda for the majority of organizations. Notably, when asked what the most attractive quality of HTML5 is, 82 percent of respondents stated that it was the ability to deploy on all kinds of phones and devices. While better quality apps are undoubtedly a benefit of HTML5, only 13 percent thought an improved design, animation and transition ability was the most attractive quality. Finally, just 5 percent expressed a preference for native applications. These figures clearly show that the main concern currently gripping the market is not so much the quality of the apps themselves (although this is no doubt integral to a successful mobile strategy), but how apps can be deployed across the fragmented realm of numerous different devices and operating systems. This is a problem that has long tormented the mobile market, and yet there is a simple solution to this challenge \u2013 by deploying a platform that uses a single code base to create optimized applications for any device, operating system or browser, developers can address all of the main devices and operating systems on the market \u2013 whether it be native, mobile web, HTML5 applications, or any hybrid combination \u2013 and only in this way can they deliver the best possible individual user experience. \u00a0</p>\n",

Companies are shifting their thinking, recognizing that customer engagement doesn\u2019t begin with a website, and can\u2019t rely on mass market \u201cpush\u201d campaigns.\u00a0 Instead, it must start with offering customers valuable, personalized content exactly where &amp; when they want it. If you need proof that mobile is driving strategy more than ever before, consider <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1607814\">Gartner\u2019s prediction </a>that by the end of 2014, more than 185 billion applications will have been downloaded from mobile app stores. Today\u2019s organizations are starting to realise that mobile cannot be an afterthought. \u00a0Instead, mobile should drive development and communications.\u00a0 Any business that thinks short-term risks losing its investment in mobile application development, as apps that are poor quality or fail to engage customers will be unsuccessful or simply redundant when new technologies storm the market place. The key to longevity in a mobile strategy is to work with a platform provider that incorporates the latest technology \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/KonyOne/Deployment%20Models/Technologies/HTML5%20%2526%20Mobile%20Web/html5-requirements\">HTML5</a>.\u00a0 This is the only way for companies to maximize their investments and truly achieve sustainability in a mobile offering. Mobile strategies don\u2019t necessarily get easier for bigger companies either.\u00a0 A major consumer brand such as Yahoo must simultaneously reach millions of consumers across many mobile devices and its strategy needs to be executed on multiple channels.\u00a0\u00a0 In my experience at Kony, most of our customers \u2013 which include some of the world\u2019s largest users of mobile \u2013 swear by a \u201cmixed mode\u201d approach which takes the best of both worlds from both <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/native\">native applications</a> and HTML5. Our future-proofed technology encompasses all forms of mobile within a single code base.\u00a0 For Kony customers, there is no need to choose, and new elements to a mobile strategy can be tailored, added and deployed with a simple press of a button. With mobile now fully integrated in our day-to-day lives, it\u2019s clear that getting your mobile strategy right is more important than ever.\u00a0 The wrong mobile solution could cost a company in reputation, wasted cycles and sales leads, while getting it right will pay off tenfold. What do you think of Yahoo\u2019s new approach? \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n",

                    "value": "<h1>&nbsp;</h1><p>With the mobile market more important than ever, <a href=\"http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/search/12022.html\">Yahoo\u2019s recent statement about adopting a \u201cmobile first\u201d approach </a>&nbsp;is a strategic and potentially lucrative move. &nbsp;At the same time however, the company discontinued ten of its mobile apps that had failed to attract large audiences, underscoring how critical it is for companies to think long-term about their mobile strategy, and build apps that truly engage customers. Companies are shifting their thinking, recognizing that customer engagement doesn\u2019t begin with a website, and can\u2019t rely on mass market \u201cpush\u201d campaigns.&nbsp; Instead, it must start with offering customers valuable, personalized content exactly where &amp; when they want it. If you need proof that mobile is driving strategy more than ever before, consider <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1607814\">Gartner\u2019s prediction </a>that by the end of 2014, more than 185 billion applications will have been downloaded from mobile app stores. Today\u2019s organizations are starting to realise that mobile cannot be an afterthought. &nbsp;Instead, mobile should drive development and communications.&nbsp; Any business that thinks short-term risks losing its investment in mobile application development, as apps that are poor quality or fail to engage customers will be unsuccessful or simply redundant when new technologies storm the market place. The key to longevity in a mobile strategy is to work with a platform provider that incorporates the latest technology \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/KonyOne/Deployment%20Models/Technologies/HTML5%20%2526%20Mobile%20Web/html5-requirements\">HTML5</a>.&nbsp; This is the only way for companies to maximize their investments and truly achieve sustainability in a mobile offering. Mobile strategies don\u2019t necessarily get easier for bigger companies either.&nbsp; A major consumer brand such as Yahoo must simultaneously reach millions of consumers across many mobile devices and its strategy needs to be executed on multiple channels.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my experience at Kony, most of our customers \u2013 which include some of the world\u2019s largest users of mobile \u2013 swear by a \u201cmixed mode\u201d approach which takes the best of both worlds from both <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/native\">native applications</a> and HTML5. Our future-proofed technology encompasses all forms of mobile within a single code base.&nbsp; For Kony customers, there is no need to choose, and new elements to a mobile strategy can be tailored, added and deployed with a simple press of a button. With mobile now fully integrated in our day-to-day lives, it\u2019s clear that getting your mobile strategy right is more important than ever.&nbsp; The wrong mobile solution could cost a company in reputation, wasted cycles and sales leads, while getting it right will pay off tenfold. What do you think of Yahoo\u2019s new approach? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

Successful HTML5 deployments will rely on having a robust and reliable development platform that supports the features and functions of current apps and devices, as well as the myriad new capabilities on the horizon. Swift deployment and adaptability are also paramount--HTML5 apps need to have the agility to cater to changing customer demands. This kind of support is guaranteed for HTML5 apps based on the <a href=\"http://kony.com/konyone-platform-launches-comprehensive-html5-support\">KonyOne</a> platform, which are covered by <a href=\"http://kony.com/\">Kony\u2019s</a> time to market SLA, and have the flexibility to support mobile web, wrapper and hybrid approaches. The effects of HTML5 go well beyond the technology and will affect long term business strategy.\u00a0 For some, a well established HTML5 deployment will streamline a company\u2019s mobile presence, while for others it can establish an effective go-to-market channel.\u00a0 Whether it is used to create apps for businesses, consumers, or for internal employee applications, HTML5 will be a key enabler of the mobile future, while co-existing with native apps.

Successful HTML5 deployments will rely on having a robust and reliable development platform that supports the features and functions of current apps and devices, as well as the myriad new capabilities on the horizon. Swift deployment and adaptability are also paramount--HTML5 apps need to have the agility to cater to changing customer demands. This kind of support is guaranteed for HTML5 apps based on the <a href=\"http://kony.com/konyone-platform-launches-comprehensive-html5-support\">KonyOne</a> platform, which are covered by <a href=\"http://kony.com/\">Kony\u2019s</a> time to market SLA, and have the flexibility to support mobile web, wrapper and hybrid approaches. The effects of HTML5 go well beyond the technology and will affect long term business strategy.&nbsp; For some, a well established HTML5 deployment will streamline a company\u2019s mobile presence, while for others it can establish an effective go-to-market channel.&nbsp; Whether it is used to create apps for businesses, consumers, or for internal employee applications, HTML5 will be a key enabler of the mobile future, while co-existing with native apps.

                    "safe_value": "<p>We all have our own preferences; it\u2019s the truth. So why not build your company\u2019s mobile strategy with the technologies that you prefer? While closed platforms, development languages and device form factors can sometimes feel like the only way, an open approach enables you to lean on your preferences, invest in non-proprietary technology and lower or even eliminate the risk of vendor lock-in. Not convinced that open is the feasible for your organization? Here are 3 more reasons why you can \u2013 and should -- take this high road approach. <strong>\u00a01.\u00a0Unique user experience</strong>. A major factor in mobile application adoption is user experience by application design. Organizations looking to develop mobile applications to improve their brand loyalty, customer service, or even employee productivity should <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/73\">use open approaches</a>\u00a0that give them the flexibility to make design decisions rather than be limited by specific mobile OS or other technology options. With an open approach you can add cool widgets easily to your mobile apps. This is a great advantage over closed approaches because you can <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/557\">pick from open third-party libraries</a> \u00a0offered by the industries\u2019 finest including Sencha, jQuery, Node.js, Dojo and more. The more compelling your consumer application is the better your chance of improving brand loyalty and even beating out the competition. Meanwhile, employees can benefit from simple widgets in their apps, which results in higher productivity and work place satisfaction. <strong>2.\u00a0Versatile support and integration</strong>. Mobile applications penetrated the market when affordable consumer smartphones were released. These devices are the entry point for mobile apps today by both consumers and employees. Companies that use an open approach are able to <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/610\">build and deploy their apps to any channel</a>\u00a0including:\n</p><ul><li>Smartphones</li>\n<li>Tablets</li>\n<li>Kiosks</li>\n<li>Desktops</li>\n<li>Feature Phones</li>\n</ul><p>A closed approach would only allow you to build and deploy to a few of these device types. An open approach supports you to offer your apps <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/mobile\">on any device without compromise</a>. It is important to note that technologies like HTML5 are also considered to be a channel and could, in the future, <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/340314/20120512/html5-mobile-web-browsers-apps-ios-android.htm\">define the next level of mobile web</a>. Ensuring that HTML5 is part of your open mobility strategy will future-proof your plans and investments. Devices have all sorts of accessories that users expect to be part of the mobile app experience. Open standards allow you to extend mobile apps using <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/598\">foreign function interface (FFI)</a>. This approach allows you include third-party workflows like barcode scanners, augmented reality, and diagnostic sensors in our mobile app experience. <strong>3.\u00a0Organizational agility and innovation.</strong> According to the Enterprise Mobility Forum, <a href=\"http://theemf.org/2012/02/27/struggling-with-byod-five-things-every-workplace-should-consider-as-they-cope-with-enterprise-mobility/\">\u201cBYOD is currently one of the most frequently discussed issues in enterprise mobility\u201d</a>. \u00a0Enterprise organizations that take an open approach to their mobility strategy are better equipped to implement a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) program. An BYOD IT Guide notes that \u201cmost recently, IT managers have begun viewing BYOD as an opportunity for driving organizational effectiveness, rather than just a syndrome to fight or avoid. Although a handful organizations have embarked on BYOD merely to save on capital equipment costs and improve their bottom line in the short term, many IT organizations have viewed the potential for lost or stolen data from the use of personal devices as not worth these savings. But recently, businesses have realized that there is more to this trend than just the tangible short-term gain. The cost saving momentum of BYOD has now been superseded by more strategic, long-term benefits of employee engagement, increased productivity, organizational agility and innovation.\u201d With these reasons, you should now at least consider an open approach to your mobile strategy. If you\u2019re already convinced, now is the time to explore your options and <a href=\"http://www.konysolutions.com/open-standards\">find the industry\u2019s most open standard based technology</a>, and yes, we will help you find it!</p>\n", 
                    "summary": "We all have our own preferences; it\u2019s the truth. So why not build your company\u2019s mobile strategy with the technologies that you prefer? ", 
                    "value": "<p>We all have our own preferences; it\u2019s the truth. So why not build your company\u2019s mobile strategy with the technologies that you prefer? While closed platforms, development languages and device form factors can sometimes feel like the only way, an open approach enables you to lean on your preferences, invest in non-proprietary technology and lower or even eliminate the risk of vendor lock-in. Not convinced that open is the feasible for your organization? Here are 3 more reasons why you can \u2013 and should -- take this high road approach. <strong>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Unique user experience</span></strong>. A major factor in mobile application adoption is user experience by application design. Organizations looking to develop mobile applications to improve their brand loyalty, customer service, or even employee productivity should <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/73\">use open approaches</a>&nbsp;that give them the flexibility to make design decisions rather than be limited by specific mobile OS or other technology options. With an open approach you can add cool widgets easily to your mobile apps. This is a great advantage over closed approaches because you can <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/557\">pick from open third-party libraries</a> &nbsp;offered by the industries\u2019 finest including Sencha, jQuery, Node.js, Dojo and more. The more compelling your consumer application is the better your chance of improving brand loyalty and even beating out the competition. Meanwhile, employees can benefit from simple widgets in their apps, which results in higher productivity and work place satisfaction. <strong>2.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Versatile support and integration</span></strong>. Mobile applications penetrated the market when affordable consumer smartphones were released. These devices are the entry point for mobile apps today by both consumers and employees. Companies that use an open approach are able to <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/610\">build and deploy their apps to any channel</a>&nbsp;including:</p><ul><li>Smartphones</li><li>Tablets</li><li>Kiosks</li><li>Desktops</li><li>Feature Phones</li></ul><p>A closed approach would only allow you to build and deploy to a few of these device types. An open approach supports you to offer your apps <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/mobile\">on any device without compromise</a>. It is important to note that technologies like HTML5 are also considered to be a channel and could, in the future, <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/340314/20120512/html5-mobile-web-browsers-apps-ios-android.htm\">define the next level of mobile web</a>. Ensuring that HTML5 is part of your open mobility strategy will future-proof your plans and investments. Devices have all sorts of accessories that users expect to be part of the mobile app experience. Open standards allow you to extend mobile apps using <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/node/598\">foreign function interface (FFI)</a>. This approach allows you include third-party workflows like barcode scanners, augmented reality, and diagnostic sensors in our mobile app experience. <strong>3.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Organizational agility and innovation.</span></strong> According to the Enterprise Mobility Forum, <a href=\"http://theemf.org/2012/02/27/struggling-with-byod-five-things-every-workplace-should-consider-as-they-cope-with-enterprise-mobility/\">\u201cBYOD is currently one of the most frequently discussed issues in enterprise mobility\u201d</a>. &nbsp;Enterprise organizations that take an open approach to their mobility strategy are better equipped to implement a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) program.

This tablet, Microsoft\u2019s first foray into hardware since the ill-fated Kin phone a few years back, will run the new Microsoft Windows 8 RT OS, a slimmed-down version of Win8 optimized for ARM chips. While the media and Apple fans <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-surface-tablets-reading-the-fine-print/12965?tag=main;carousel\">ponder Microsoft\u2019s chances in this high-stakes game</a>, our customers \u2013 and executives just like them who are responsible for their company\u2019s mobility strategies \u2013 are wondering how seriously to take this new entry. Factors like price point, battery life, and pre-installed apps and games were conspicuously missing from this week\u2019s announcement, but they all play a major role in whether this new platform gains traction in the market, or goes the way of the <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/mobile-gadgeteer/goodbye-zune-hello-xbox-music/5803?tag=search-results-rivers;item11\">Zune</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.computerworld.com/18827/which_was_more_disastrous_microsofts_kin_or_hps_webos\">Kin</a>devices before it. So, a few initial thoughts from the Kony team:\n</p><ol><li>The Microsoft Surface tablet is first and foremost a consumer device, optimized for consumer must-haves such as <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/global/surface/en/us/renderingassets/surfacespecsheet.pdf\">fast startup, touch interface, eye-catching graphics and screen resolution</a>, etc. Its success will depend on its ability to appeal to consumers\u2019 fickle tastes, price sensitivity, and perhaps, brand-consciousness.</li>\n<li>That said, consumers have a notable habit of blurring the lines between their home and business lives, bringing their devices in to work and requesting corporate IT support them with corporate applications and access to the company intranet and other networks. This is sometimes dubbed \u201c<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9228112/A_third_of_IT_shops_support_personal_smartphones_tablets_at_work_\">Consumerization of IT</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"http://www.kony.com/resources/white-papers\">Bring Your Own Device</a>\u201d</li>\n<li>Because of this blurring, Microsoft\u2019s bundling of Office apps, seamless support for Exchange, and, of course, the security and manageability of Windows itself \u2013 may become the features that spur this device\u2019s success, at least among certain demographics.</li>\n<li>Longer term, Microsoft\u2019s goal is to preserve and extend its flagship Windows brand, which means the Surface is part of a broader assault on Apple that will marshal a flotilla of tablet devices, laptops, ultra books, and even \u2013 gasp -- desktop machines, based on the new <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/apps\">Windows 8 OS</a>, starting this holiday season.</li>\n<li>Two days after the Surface announcement, Microsoft unveiled its latest plans for <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-57456648-85/windows-phone-8-os-opens-up-to-multicore-processors-nfc/?tag=TOCcarouselMain.0\">Windows Phone 8</a>, the next generation of its revamped mobile platform. Among other enhancements including NFC and Skype support, Windows Phone 8 will share much of the same codebase with Windows 8, enabling developers to create apps that run seamlessly across phone, tablet, laptop and desktop \u2013 all downloadable from the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/apps\">Microsoft Store</a>.</li>\n</ol><p>So how should mobility managers respond to all this? A couple of recommendations:\n</p><ol><li>If your mobility strategy targets consumers, we would recommend you keep an eye on this new tablet and monitor how well it delivers on the key apps, games, etc. consumers look for. Also note whether Microsoft can truly deliver a single app store for all devices, and watch to see whether developers deliver new compelling content on the Microsoft\u2019s store. If you find the Surface gaining some traction in these areas, begin <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/konyone\">building a strategy</a> for deploying select apps or your entire portfolio to it sometime next year.</li>\n<li>If you need to support mobile information workers who are bringing in their own devices, consider a pilot of the Microsoft Surface and some of the third-party Windows 8 tablets and ultrabooks over the next year. You may find at least some of these devices can meet end users\u2019 need for instant-on, touch functionality while still meeting your need for corporate data security and improved manageability. In the meantime, if you haven\u2019t already, have a look at Kony\u2019s new <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/mobile-application-management-mam\">Mobile Application Management</a> technologies for provisioning, managing, securing and analyzing corporate mobile apps.</li>\n<li>For specialized mobile workers such as field service technicians, mobile pharmacy reps, transportation/logistics workers, and insurance agents, keep picking the device that best provides the form/function/ruggedization required \u2013 and don\u2019t forget to check out Kony\u2019s array of <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/Solutions/enterprise-solutions\">pre-packaged mobile business apps</a> for these functions, available for all the major channels including \u2013 very soon \u2013 Windows 8.</li>\n</ol><p>Will Microsoft\u2019s latest move be enough to stem the flow of iPads, iPhones and Android devices under our Christmas trees and into office environments this year? Probably not immediately, but Microsoft appears to be in this for the long haul. For our part, we don\u2019t think this game is necessarily over yet.</p>\n",

For mobile marketing and e-commerce execs, HTML5 offers a potential way to deliver a consistent user experience across smartphones and tablets, as well as a way to push updates and new features extremely rapidly.

Here at Kony, we field the question daily: How should we approach HTML5, and what role does the Kony mobile application platform play in an HTML5 environment? \u00a0There are fundamentally three perspectives on this:\n</p><ul><li><strong>For CIOs and IT Directors driving corporate application strategies</strong>, HTML5 is \u2013 mostly \u2013 an opportunity, not a threat. By unleashing the talents of their web development teams to extend corporate apps to mobile devices, these CIOs can drive productivity and efficiency gains while meeting end-user demands for instant-on, media-rich mobile functionality, particularly for those apps that don\u2019t require offline capability. The question for these IT chiefs is really around how to get there from here: with the standard still evolving and immature/untested in many ways, CIOs need to <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/resources\">devise a strategy</a> that takes advantage of what\u2019s available now, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for future app development. With the substantial infrastructure needed to support HTML5 for mobile apps, we\u2019ve found IT shops can get there faster, better, and with more long-term sustainability by utilizing the KonyOne Platform for their HTML5 and hybrid or mixed-mode HTML5/Native app development. To see how this breaks down into a vastly lower Total Cost of Ownership for HTML5 apps, please <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/about-us/contact-us\">contact us</a> to perform a detailed analysis of your environment.</li>\n</ul><ul><li><strong>For marketing and e-commerce execs</strong> - and really anyone charged with driving customer retention and loyalty - HTML5 is both an opportunity and a threat, best approached with extreme caution. On the one hand, there are those billion HTML5-enabled phones. On the other, there\u2019s the need to deliver rich, compelling, \u201csticky\u201d experiences to keep fickle consumers delighted and loyal \u2013 something that is next to impossible to deliver in HTML5 only. Plus, of course, there\u2019s the issue of how to get consumers to notice and access your app in the first place, whether it\u2019s mobile web-based or native. On this topic, at least one industry commentator sees <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-57329259-250/html5-will-kill-mobile-apps-no-it-wont/?tag=mncol;txt\">native apps gaining the edge</a> well into the foreseeable future, due to the simple fact that \u201cpure\u201d mobile web apps don\u2019t appear in app stores, which are the primary destination for consumers looking for great mobile experiences. This can be mitigated with hybrid development focused on \u201cwrapping\u201d the mobile web code with native code, so that the app can appear in the app store, but this tactic introduces new complexities. At Kony we\u2019re not taking sides \u2013 we\u2019re just looking to help mobile marketers deliver the best functionality possible, utilizing all of the technologies at their disposal. For this reason, we\u2019ve created <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/kony-applications\">pre-built apps</a> that run in native and HTML5 modes across all the popular mobile channels, supported by our platform and configurability tools to give you even more options. For a detailed discussion of the ins and outs of HTML5 and native options for B2C apps, visit the webinars in our <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/resources\">Resources Center</a>.</li>\n</ul><ul><li><strong>For developers of all varieties</strong>, HTML5 is a huge opportunity, when handled in a smart and strategic way. The unfortunate reality for most developers, whether going with HTML5, native app development, or a hybrid combination of the two, is that creating mobile apps by hand is difficult, time consuming, and tedious.\u00a0 Instead of being able to focus on what makes their apps great, developers spend most of their time dealing with getting the plumbing working; getting forms to appear and look correct on multiple devices; getting data to come back quickly and reliably; and dealing with an unending list of differences in what is supported ( or not ) on different platforms.\u00a0 And while HTML5 was supposed to make this all go away (and make it easy for anyone to turn out a great cross-device mobile apps), the truth is that HTML5 is just as difficult to develop in and support as native application development, but for a host of different reasons.\u00a0 (For a site that helps you figure out which of your features HTML5 supports and how, visit <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#compare=ios_saf+3.2,ios_saf+4.0-4.1,ios_saf+4.2-4.3,ios_saf+5.0-5.1,ios_saf+6,android+2.1,android+2.2,android+2.3,android+3,android+4\">When Can I Use</a> \u2013 also check out <a href=\"http://html5please.com/\">HTML5 Please</a>). Factor in to this that there is little cross-browser agreement on how tags are implemented - or what features are supported - and HTML5 development can quickly become a spaghetti mess of browser detection scripts and unending CSS declarations. And by the way, some or alot of it may break with HTML6.</li>\n</ul><p>So for developers, we recommend this: Figure out whether HTML5 makes sense for the use cases and end users you\u2019re targeting; figure out how much of your target app you can cover using HTML5 (in our experience this is generally between 40 and 70 percent), then build a strategy for how you\u2019ll create your first version - which is likely to be some type of hybrid - and how you might be able to migrate that to HTML5 as the standard evolves and if your app\u2019s requirements demand it.The KonyOne platform supports this process because it lets you create your application definition one time with the <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/kony-one/tools\">KonyOne Studio</a>, and then let Kony\u2019s build process generate native app, hybrids, wrappers and browser-specific outputs.\u00a0 As the mobile environment changes, Kony handles keeping up with the details with <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/about-us\">our SLA</a>, letting you focus on delivering amazing applications.\u00a0 Instead of having to tell your business that you can\u2019t deliver new functionality because you are still supporting the old application, you can be building out world class applications, knowing that they\u2019ll work regardless of what channels the business wants to support, or what changes the OS and device manufacturers make.\u00a0 Not only are you ready to deploy for HTML5 (with outputs tailored for each browser), you can also generate native iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Symbian, Web OS, and JavaME apps \u2013 if that\u2019s what your business needs.\u00a0 Bottom line, the KonyOne Studio allows you to <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/konyone\">focus on delivering the business value</a> instead of getting bogged down in the minutiae of hand coding for your mobile development. There\u2019s no doubt about it: HTML5 is an exciting development for our industry. With the right strategy, tools, and team, business managers and developers of all types should be able to leverage it to design stunning mobile experiences for their end-users \u2013 watch this space for more thoughts from our team around how to do just that.</p>\n",

For a detailed discussion of the ins and outs of HTML5 and native options for B2C apps, visit the webinars in our <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/resources\">Resources Center</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>For developers of all varieties</strong>, HTML5 is a huge opportunity, when handled in a smart and strategic way. The unfortunate reality for most developers, whether going with HTML5, native app development, or a hybrid combination of the two, is that creating mobile apps by hand is difficult, time consuming, and tedious.&nbsp; Instead of being able to focus on what makes their apps great, developers spend most of their time dealing with getting the plumbing working; getting forms to appear and look correct on multiple devices; getting data to come back quickly and reliably; and dealing with an unending list of differences in what is supported ( or not ) on different platforms.&nbsp; And while HTML5 was supposed to make this all go away (and make it easy for anyone to turn out a great cross-device mobile apps), the truth is that HTML5 is just as difficult to develop in and support as native application development, but for a host of different reasons.&nbsp; (For a site that helps you figure out which of your features HTML5 supports and how, visit <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#compare=ios_saf+3.2,ios_saf+4.0-4.1,ios_saf+4.2-4.3,ios_saf+5.0-5.1,ios_saf+6,android+2.1,android+2.2,android+2.3,android+3,android+4\">When Can I Use</a> \u2013 also check out <a href=\"http://html5please.com/\">HTML5 Please</a>). Factor in to this that there is little cross-browser agreement on how tags are implemented - or what features are supported - and HTML5 development can quickly become a spaghetti mess of browser detection scripts and unending CSS declarations. And by the way, some or alot of it may break with HTML6.</li></ul><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">So for developers, we recommend this: Figure out whether HTML5 makes sense for the use cases and end users you\u2019re targeting; figure out how much of your target app you can cover using HTML5 (in our experience this is generally between 40 and 70 percent), then build a strategy for how you\u2019ll create your first version - which is likely to be some type of hybrid - and how you might be able to migrate that to HTML5 as the standard evolves and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if</span> your app\u2019s requirements demand it.</p><p>The KonyOne platform supports this process because it lets you create your application definition one time with the <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/kony-one/tools\">KonyOne Studio</a>, and then let Kony\u2019s build process generate native app, hybrids, wrappers and browser-specific outputs.&nbsp; As the mobile environment changes, Kony handles keeping up with the details with <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/about-us\">our SLA</a>, letting you focus on delivering amazing applications.&nbsp; Instead of having to tell your business that you can\u2019t deliver new functionality because you are still supporting the old application, you can be building out world class applications, knowing that they\u2019ll work regardless of what channels the business wants to support, or what changes the OS and device manufacturers make.&nbsp; Not only are you ready to deploy for HTML5 (with outputs tailored for each browser), you can also generate native iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Symbian, Web OS, and JavaME apps \u2013 if that\u2019s what your business needs.&nbsp; Bottom line, the KonyOne Studio allows you to <a href=\"http://www.kony.com/konyone\">focus on delivering the business value</a> instead of getting bogged down in the minutiae of hand coding for your mobile development. There\u2019s no doubt about it: HTML5 is an exciting development for our industry. With the right strategy, tools, and team, business managers and developers of all types should be able to leverage it to design stunning mobile experiences for their end-users \u2013 watch this space for more thoughts from our team around how to do just that.</p>"

What do they even mean when they say that? Well, I can\u2019t speak for every software maker in the world, but I can tell you what we here at Kony mean by these terms. When we say \u201cOpen\u201d we mean specifically \u201cNot Proprietary\u201d \u2013 as in no proprietary programming languages, development environments, middleware services, or back-end connectors or adapters.\u00a0 In other words, no vendor lock-in. When we say \u201cStandards-Based\u201d we mean specifically \u201cUtilizing Common and Accepted Official and Unofficial Industry Standards\u201d such as Javascri[t, CSS, HTML5, J2EE, CSS, REST, SOAP, \u00a0XML, and industry standard web services. So what this means in practice is that we deliver an open and standards-based environment for all phases of the mobile software lifecycle: <strong>1. Develop</strong>: Instead of a proprietary language or SDK, Kony delivers a Javascript-based, Eclipse plug-in IDE.. Kony-built apps are configurable through drag-and-drop wireframing alongside other visual IDE tools, and also hand-coding if you should choose to work directly in Javascript for portions of your app development. The apps you write can be deployed to a native OS including iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian or Windows, or to mobile web browsers supporting HTML5 or older \u2018legacy\u2019 web browsers as required. Most importantly, Kony\u2019s version of \u201copen and standards-based\u201d does not equate to \u201clowest common denominator.: This is because we also give you thousands of native and custom APIs, cross-platform APIs, and support for FFI to utilize device-specific SDKs and functionality. Last but not least, you can leverage third-party Javascript libraries from vendors such as Sencha JQuery right inside the Kony IDE so you can create an optimized experience for each device type. Our IDE strives for this \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d solution \u2013 fast IDE development without compromising the ability to tweak and customize with stunning functionality, an unparalleled user experience and branding elements. <strong>2. Deploy</strong>: \u00a0The Kony Server is similarly designed around open and standards-based architectural principles: it can be deployed on any existing or standalone J2EE server including Websphere, Tomcat and Weblogic. Backend integration is accomplished using industry standard connectors and web services, including:\n</p><ul><li>Native SAP ERP and CRM JCo-based connectivity</li>\n<li>Native Oracle Siebel connectivity</li>\n<li>Oracle PeopleSoft connectivity</li>\n<li>Microsoft SharePoint</li>\n<li>Content management systems (CMS)</li>\n</ul><p>Meanwhile, custom back-end systems can be accessed via:\n</p><ul><li>Web Services</li>\n<li>XML, REST, OFX-based services</li>\n<li>JDBC &amp; ODBC Database Services</li>\n<li>jWay Connectors (providing connectivity to over 300+ sources)</li>\n<li>Legacy systems using Data Connector Adapters</li>\n<li>Data sources like Oracle, DB2, MySQL, MS SQL, etc.</li>\n<li>Custom built connectors</li>\n<li>News feeds and video streaming such as RSS and RTSP</li>\n<li>Composite services</li>\n</ul><p><strong>3.\u00a0 Manage</strong>: Unlike more proprietary mobile device management and mobile application management systems, Kony\u2019s open approach extends to our Kony Mobile App Manager \u00a0(MAM) product, which delivers policy management, analytics, reporting, device commissioning and decommissioning, a best-in-class enterprise app store and secure app container functionality - all from a single, open web-based console. Kony\u2019s MAM can manage and provision apps built with the KonyOne Platform, as well as third-party and commercial apps developed outside the platform. It\u2019s true that open architectures are important for a reason \u2013 no one wants to get locked into a proprietary environment they can\u2019t migrate out of if their business needs dictate that they do so. We\u2019ve taken this edict from our customers extremely seriously and have worked hard to design a system that intelligently combines openness with power and flexibility to enable developers to build once, deploy everywhere, across more than 10,000 device types in any country and in any language.

Multi-channel use cases, management, analysis \u2013 the whole enchilada. So what is multi-channel anyway? We can answer that question with three distinct, but related, concepts : <strong>1) Same app, any screen</strong>. Whether your end users are employees, consumers or partners, chances are they own or have been issued several types of devices. At a minimum they have a desktop machine and a phone, and expect to access their email, calendar, apps, games, media and more on both - seamlessly and with the experience optimized for each form factor. But increasingly, many have a desktop or laptop, plus a phone, plus a tablet, and very soon, a smart TV. On top of the devices they carry, users will soon also expect seamless access to their apps and more on kiosks, in-dash systems, home automation systems and game consoles.\u00a0 The multi-channel vision is to give these users access to everything they want, on any device, including but not limited to their mobile phones. In other words, including their 32-bit desktop and desktop web experiences and indeed, every automated system they encounter. <strong>Consider a day in the life of a sales manager:</strong> When she wakes up in the morning, chances are very good that she has her smartphone in hand within moments. She checks email, calendar, and maybe one or two native or hybrid apps that give her news, weather, stock information or important sports scores. In the parking lot at a customer site after a rushed coffee and bagel, before her visit she uses the instant-on, touch-screen convenience of her tablet to check her CRM system wirelessly, accessing the customer\u2019s key account information, order history, and notes from their last meeting. After the meeting and in the same parking lot - using a few simple buttons and selecting mostly from pull-down options - she may update the CRM system from that tablet before heading to the office. Once in the office, she\u2019ll want to access the whole array of corporate systems from her laptop or desktop machine \u2013 but the look and feel of what she encounters on her connected monitor and through keyboard/mouse interactions are fundamentally different and more detailed than what she accessed earlier in the day on her mobile devices. Where the tablet or phone gave her simple buttons, pull-down menus and perhaps the option of voice commands, the desktop system utilizes the larger real estate of her monitor to give her tabbed menus, full input fields, dashboard views, data mining, and more. Later, as she heads out to dinner with another client that evening, her phone and in-dash system provide recommendations for great restaurants near her client\u2019s office as well as spoken GPS driving directions to get there. So the day goes, with each task \u2013 whether personal or business \u2013 optimized to the device or machine she is utilizing, to her location, her preferences, the time of day, and to her immediate computing needs. <strong>2) Unified approach to getting the right content, to the right person, at the right time</strong>. It follows from much of the above that multi-channel requires some rethinking of how we push apps, media, websites, etc. to each user based on who they are, what device they\u2019re carrying, what function they\u2019re trying to perform, where they are located, what security clearances they have, and more. Not a ton of rethinking, but as user expectations grow, it behooves mobility teams to look at how they can simplify and streamline app design, development, and deployment to maximize multi-channel delivery. <strong>3) Seamless multi-channel management</strong>. Today, mobility teams expect to manage and monitor mobile devices carried by employees, and many are looking at how to expand that management to encompass mobile applications and content. But as users increasingly blend their personal and professional use of devices and machines of all types, this vision of mobile management will need to change also. Mobility managers will need to take each user\u2019s situation, their mix of personal and business apps, security and privacy needs \u2013 as well as form factor considerations -into account for each of the\u00a0 design, develop, deploy, manage and analyze stages to truly optimize the next generation of multi-channel solutions. At Kony, we\u2019ve been talking with many of our customers about multi-channel for a while now, and actually just this month implemented for a major client our first completely multi-channel app \u2013 spanning mobile phones, tablets, and Desktop Web.\u00a0 These conversations, like the topic itself, are multi-faceted and cross a wide variety of disciplines. Later next month we\u2019ll be hosting a webinar with Gartner analyst Gordon Van Huizen on the topic of \u201cMulti-Channel: Easier Said than Done\u201d. Watch this space for updates and an invitation to join the interactive webinar. \u00a0As always, please reach out to us with your ideas and questions.</p>\n",

So, is Zuckerberg right? Is it a mistake to bet on HTML5?\u00a0 At Kony we would say yes and no. Yes, he\u2019s right that it was an error to bet the company\u2019s flagship property for the most popular mobile channel in the world on a single mobile architecture. But that said, we don\u2019t believe this means there\u2019s no future for HTML5. Instead we would say in all cases, pick the architecture that fits the job you need your app to do. In some cases, HTML5 will work beautifully and will be the most cost-effective and elegant way to accomplish the goal. In others, native apps will be needed to say,<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-says-on-mobile-we-are-going-to-make-a-lot-more-money-than-on-desktop/\" target=\"_blank\"> monetize the app effectively</a> or to drive unique user experiences only available from the targeted device. In still other scenarios, the best approach will be a combination of native, HTML5, hybrid and mixed-mode apps. Kony happens to have a platform that enables you to deliver exactly the app type, to exactly the channels you want, to business users, consumers, or both \u2013 extremely rapidly and with minimal hand coding.

But that said, we don\u2019t believe this means there\u2019s no future for HTML5. Instead we would say in all cases, pick the architecture that fits the job you need your app to do. In some cases, HTML5 will work beautifully and will be the most cost-effective and elegant way to accomplish the goal. In others, native apps will be needed to say,<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-says-on-mobile-we-are-going-to-make-a-lot-more-money-than-on-desktop/\" target=\"_blank\"> monetize the app effectively</a> or to drive unique user experiences only available from the targeted device. In still other scenarios, the best approach will be a combination of native, HTML5, hybrid and mixed-mode apps. Kony happens to have a platform that enables you to deliver exactly the app type, to exactly the channels you want, to business users, consumers, or both \u2013 extremely rapidly and with minimal hand coding.

So, is Zuckerberg right? Is it a mistake to bet on HTML5?\u00a0 At Kony we would say yes and no. Yes, he\u2019s right that it was an error to bet the company\u2019s flagship property for the most popular mobile channel in the world on a single mobile architecture. But that said, we don\u2019t believe this means there\u2019s no future for HTML5. Instead we would say in all cases, pick the architecture that fits the job you need your app to do. In some cases, HTML5 will work beautifully and will be the most cost-effective and elegant way to accomplish the goal. In others, native apps will be needed to say, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-says-on-mobile-we-are-going-to-make-a-lot-more-money-than-on-desktop/\">monetize the app effectively</a> or to drive unique user experiences only available from the targeted device. In still other scenarios, the best approach will be a combination of native, HTML5, hybrid and mixed-mode apps.
